A public-private partnership (P3) is a partnership whereby the public partner (government entity) signs an agreement with a private entity to achieve mutually beneficial goals. In some cases, the government delegates some of its own responsibilities to a private partner under a contract that defines the rights and obligations of each party during the term as well. They are an important tool for testing innovations, developing new infrastructure, and typically involve investment and operation and maintenance.
