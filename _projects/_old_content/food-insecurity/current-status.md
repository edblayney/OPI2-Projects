We have a hackathon scheduled right now for mid-February with a few local partners, Develop Louisville, Compassionate Louisville, Metro United Way, Humana, Dare to Care, Brown Forman and the Community Foundation, in addition to representation from U of L, Bellarmine and of course our local Code for America non-profit chapter the Civic Data Alliance. This will allow us to create a myriad of approaches to address food insecurity in our community.
