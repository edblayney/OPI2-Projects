## Introduction

We've been working with several local partners in the food industry in the Louisville Metro area since March to coordinate efforts and identify issues around food accessibility and security for our citizens. We have found that as food security is a systemic issue, a single solution to attempt to affect the problem would have negligible impact. We have amassed a large network of non-profit, for-profit and community stakeholders to share knowledge of current efforts, and provide program coordination communications.
