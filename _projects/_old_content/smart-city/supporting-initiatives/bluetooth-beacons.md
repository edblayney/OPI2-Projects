## In Partnership with American Printing House for the Blind

We have partnered with the American Printing House for the Blind to install low power, bluetooth beacons in public buildings, and map these indoor spaces for accessibility and public usage, with all data generated contributed to OpenStreetMap. It is an exciting and innovative opportunity to improve public buildings for all in our community.

This technology was recently promoted and demonstrated to an audience from the NewDEAL organization (Developing Exceptional American Leaders), a national network of progressive state and local leaders.


## Elistik Partnership

A public/private partnership with a local startup that enables us to connect citizens digitally to the analog process of a governmental agency. This application will advertise to citizens available services, forms & surveys when they arrive at a physical public service area and connects digital experiences to the physical built environment. This application will utilize the bluetooth beacon network that is currently being deployed by the American Printing House for the Blind.
