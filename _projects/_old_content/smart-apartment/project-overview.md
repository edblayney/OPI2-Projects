## Introduction

CNET's Urban Smart Home is a 1,400 square foot apartment that CNET has filled with the latest technology to automate living spaces and connect them with data that can put them in the fast lane for the digital age. It's a natural extension of the CNET Smart Home, a suburban showcase home in Louisville that CNET owns and has been using to test and report on the latest home tech for the past couple years.

The best part of CNET's approach is that it's not focused on technology for the rich-and-famous. Instead, it's testing off-the-shelf tech that anyone can find at a local retailer and integrate into their living space.



By the same token, the Office of Civic Innovation smart city initiatives aren't just focused on important internal stuff like making gigantic buildings more energy efficient. Rather, it has focused its efforts on things that have a direct impact on the community, such as crowdsourced air quality studies, crowdsourced bandwidth speed testing across the community, and a partnership with Waze to help manage traffic congestion with data.

## Inventory of projects

- Smart Assistant Skills (Alexa, Google Assistant)

By engaging with our local Code for America chapter, the Civic Data Alliance, we have created a number of community developed skills, primarily for (but not limited to) the Amazon Alexa digital assistant. This allows us to experiment with voice interaction, a new channel for digital services. As all citizens own, leverage and use different technology platforms, we currently have a multi-platform digital assistant solution in development that will address the need for a platform agnostic solution.

- IFTTT (digital services)

An open source project, freely available and licensed on GitHub. We have created a new channel for governments to deliver light touch digital services, that empower the citizen to customize their interaction with government while maintaining respect for their privacy. The IFTTT service has a tightly controlled user experience that allows us to present a consistent service to our citizens, in an era of poorly designed government app experiences. It allows us to democratize and operationalize data to our citizens, solving a historic issue with Open Data, providing immediate and applicable value to the initiative. Louisville is the first government partner on platform, which initiated the creation and adoption of Data Access Project by IFTTT.
