## Understand what people need

We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should inform technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.

## Inventory of projects

### Smart Assistant Skills (Alexa, Google Assistant)

By engaging with our local Code for America chapter, the Civic Data Alliance, we have created a number of community developed skills, primarily for (but not limited to) the Amazon Alexa digital assistant. This allows us to experiment with voice interaction, a new channel for digital services. As all citizens own, leverage and use different technology platforms, we currently have a multi-platform digital assistant solution in development that will address the need for a platform agnostic solution.

### IFTTT

An open source project, freely available and licensed on GitHub. We have created a new channel for governments to deliver light touch digital services, that empower the citizen to customize their interaction with government while maintaining respect for their privacy. The IFTTT service has a tightly controlled user experience that allows us to present a consistent service to our citizens, in an era of poorly designed government app experiences. It allows us to democratize and operationalize data to our citizens, solving a historic issue with Open Data, providing immediate and applicable value to the initiative. Louisville is the first government partner on platform, which initiated the creation and adoption of Data Access Project by IFTTT.

### Elistik Partnership

A public/private partnership with a local startup that enables us to connect citizens digitally to the analog process of a governmental agency. This application will advertise to citizens available services, forms & surveys when they arrive at a physical public service area and connects digital experiences to the physical built environment. This application will utilize the bluetooth beacon network that is currently being deployed by the American Printing House for the Blind.
