## Introduction

The Office of Performance Improvement & Innovation views hackathons as a key component of our strategy to not only institutionalize innovation, but to connect with our citizens, the tech community and any of our project stakeholders. It is a critical piece of collaborative strategy in the generation of civic engagement, relationship building and problem solving. We have an open office hack night, once a month with our local Code for America chapter, the non-profit Civic Data Alliance, in addition to a quarterly capstone hackathon that encapsulates all of the previous quarter focus areas. This is in addition to nation-wide events, such as the National Civic Data of Hacking.
