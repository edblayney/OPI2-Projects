Today, participation in society relies on the ability to access and use the internet effectively.Whether applying for a job, doing homework, or starting a business, all our residents need digital skills, tools, and connectivity to fully participate in modern society. These factors are increasingly becoming the choke points that prevent thousands of our citizens from adapting to and accessing the benefits of a knowledge-driven, innovative economy.

To promote digital inclusion in Louisville, Louisville Metro Government and over 10 partnering agencies, including the Louisville Metro Housing Authority, KentuckianaWorks and Louisville Free Public Library, have been working diligently to increase the equity of access to the internet and technology across the city. In May 2017, we released Louisvilleâ€™s [Digital Inclusion Plan](https://digitalinclusion.louisvilleky.gov), a blueprint for substantially decreasing the digital divide in Louisville.

This plan focuses on the following three [focus areas](http://digitalinclusion.louisvilleky.gov/our-focus-areas):

* **Connectivity:** increasing home internet access
* **Digital Skills:** teaching the necessary skills to use modern technology
* **Hardware:** bringing computers (laptops and desktops) into homes

To make progress on these plans, we have started projects such as:
* Louisville Fiber Information Technology project, which is building fiber all over the Louisville Metro area
* Low-cost internet sign-ups
* A computer refurbishment program with Fern Creek High School
* Created the PNC Gigabit Experience Center, an open-access community technology center in the Russell Neighborhood
* Grow with Google digital skills training the Louisville Metro Housing Authority
* ConnectHome USA with the Louisville Metro Housing Authority

Our digital inclusion efforts focus on three areas of work: improving connectivity, teaching digital skills and providing hardware. We leverage a number of programs and relationship to further our commitment to decreasing digital inequity. This will enable us to improve the quality of life for our citizens by providing them with the digital tools and skills they need for success.

o SpeedUpLouisville project SpeedUpLouisville.com collects user-generated information about local broadband service speeds, rates and service quality in our community. This tool will help citizens, businesses, policymakers and others better understand where Louisville residents can access high-quality Internet service, and where there are needs. Once collected, the data will be displayed on an interactive map and available for free download, with the goal of increasing transparency about Internet service quality in Louisville and to continue the conversation around fiber in our community.

o Internet Signups, Hardware & Skills

The civic innovation team has been attending back-to-school events, and other community gatherings in an effort to sign up our citizens for already existing, but poorly publicized low cost internet plans from ISP that operate in the Louisville area. To date 386 households have been signed up, with a target of 500. This initiative also utilizes cleaned & refurbished donated computers from local businesses to get these households reliable access to a computer. Additionally, we are forming partnerships with local and national technology companies to create a digital skills training program, to educate households that may need assistance in utilizing these technologies.

o Gigabit Experience Center

A public private partnership with PNC Bank that resulted in the creation of a space in Louisville, wired with gigabit speed internet access, with exhibits and opportunities for citizens to gain hands-on experience with this new technology. This allows us to engage all of Louisville regarding the potential of gigabit internet speeds and the importance of understanding and embracing technology. It collaboratively supports local business and economic development to achieve optimum efficiency and effectiveness using collective community resources, and empowers individuals, business concerns and organizations with knowledge and skills. Strategically focused on economic transformation of under-served areas of West Louisville.
