The future of the Smart City is constantly being redefined, and by extension our relationship with citizens. The advent of the Smart Home offers an opportunity to connect with our constituents in new and exciting ways that weren't previously possible. The following projects illustrate our strategy of testing different technologies to democratize government data (preferably Open Data) and put it in useful contextual applications for our citizens.

o Smart Assistant Skills (Alexa, Google Assistant)

By engaging with our local Code for America chapter, the Civic Data Alliance, we have created a number of community developed skills, primarily for (but not limited to) the Amazon Alexa digital assistant. This allows us to experiment with voice interaction, a new channel for digital services. As all citizens own, leverage and use different technology platforms, we currently have

a multi-platform digital assistant solution in development that will address the need for a platform agnostic solution. Please see - https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dalexa-skills&field-keywords=Louisville

o IFTTT (digital services)

An open source project, freely available and licensed on GitHub. We have created a new channel for governments to deliver light touch digital services, that empower the citizen to customize their interaction with government while maintaining respect for their privacy. The IFTTT service has a tightly controlled user experience that allows us to present a consistent service to our citizens, in an era of poorly designed government app experiences. It allows us to democratize and operationalize data to our citizens, solving a historic issue with Open Data, providing immediate and applicable value to the initiative. Louisville is the first government partner on platform, which initiated the creation and adoption of Data Access Project by IFTTT.

o Elistik Partnership (bluetooth beacon app)

A public/private partnership with a local startup that enables us to connect citizens digitally to the analog process of a governmental agency. This application will advertise to citizens available services, forms & surveys when they arrive at a physical public service area and connects digital experiences to the physical built environment. This application will utilize the bluetooth beacon network that is currently being deployed by the American Printing House for the Blind.
